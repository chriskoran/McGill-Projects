# BIOL 301 — Directed Evolution of mNeonGreen

## Overview
Final lab report investigating whether random mutagenesis (error-prone PCR) of the fluorescent protein **mNeonGreen** can generate variants with altered fluorescence properties.

**Report (PDF):** `report/BIOL301_FinalLabReport_mNeonGreen.pdf`

## What we did
- Generated mutant libraries using **error-prone PCR (EP-PCR)**
- Cloned into **pUC18-His**, transformed **E. coli**, screened colony fluorescence
- Validated candidates with **restriction digest** and **Sanger sequencing**
- Assessed structural context with **protein modeling**
- Compared expression via **Western blot**
- Characterized purified protein using **spectrofluorimetry** and **photobleaching assays**

## Key results (high level)
- **M3** (L19M, A192V, M231V): fluorescence behavior was statistically similar to wild-type across metrics tested.
- **M4** (I67T, chromophore-proximal): reduced fluorescence intensity, shifted excitation/emission maxima, increased pKa, and altered photobleaching behavior.
- Western blot indicated **lower expression of M4** vs wild-type/M3, likely contributing to reduced signal.
